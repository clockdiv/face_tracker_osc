## Privacy Policy

The [data protection regulations](https://www.hfs-berlin.de/datenschutz/) of the "Ernst Busch" Academy of Dramatic Arts apply. 

In addition, the following provision applies:

### Facial Tracking
The Face Tracker OSC app (iOS) uses the iPhone’s TrueDepth camera system to track the movement of a user’s facial expressions. For this to work, the app requires access to the user’s device camera. 

The only use of this information is to track the user’s head and face to send the data of the tracked feature points to any remote device in the local network. This remote device must be specified by the user.

None of the information collected by the TrueDepth API ever leaves the user's device in any other way nor is it persistently stored on the device. Face Tracker OSC will not store, or retain, any data captured by the TrueDepth camera on servers or use customer face data for any purpose other than the app’s core functionality. The Face Tracker OSC app does not and will not use customer face data to personally identify any user. Contact us if you have any privacy questions, concerns or suggestions.
